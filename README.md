## Challenge Summary 
![](Repo/June.PNG)

The average temperature is 74F (23 degree) and minimum temperature is 64F(17 degree) in June

![](Repo/December.PNG)

The average temperature in December is 71F (21 degree) and minimum is 56F (13 degree).

June is the starting of the summer month and December is one of the winter months. By picking up these two months allow us to understand the  difference between summer temperature and winter temperature . However, when Hawaii is a subtropical climiate and therefore, there are no hugh difference among the temperature for the whole year. The biggest influence for travellers should be the frequency and the amount of rainfalls in Hawaii.
